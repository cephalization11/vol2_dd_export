This script is designed to take in a comma-separated list of item numbers 
and produce a custom version of Chapter X from Standards for Cancer Registries, 
Volume II: Data Standards and Data Dictionary which only contains information 
about the requested data items.

To use the script, you must create comma-separated list of data items that
you wish to extract from the Data Dictionary. An example is provided for you
in the file example_items.csv which is part of the download.

For more information on the installation of Python and the usage of the
script, see the wiki at https://github.com/naaccr/vol2_dd_export/wiki.
