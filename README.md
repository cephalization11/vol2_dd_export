This Python script allows the user to create their own, custom version
of Chapter X (Data Dictionary) from NAACCR's Standards for Cancer 
Registries, Volume II: Data Standards and Data Dictionary. All that is
required to run the script is an installed version of Python 3.0 or
later and a CSV file with a comma-separated list of the data item numbers
to be used in creating the document.

For more information on the installation of Python and the usage of the
script, see the wiki at https://github.com/naaccr/vol2_dd_export/wiki.
