This Python script allows the user to create their own, custom version
of Chapter X (Data Dictionary) from NAACCR's Standards for Cancer 
Registries, Volume II: Data Standards and Data Dictionary. All that is
required to run the script is an installed version of Python 3.0 or
later and a CSV file with a comma-separated list of the data item numbers
to be used in creating the document.

For more information on the usage of the script, run the script in a
terminal with the -h flag or with no parameters.
